XML Travelgate uses [jekyll-docs] to render blog and documentation.

After working with rst format and rendering with [readthedocs], we decided to begin use more standard md formats rendering to html using [jekyll]

Once we choose the tools we choos objectives:
- Unify documentation articles, blogs, internal documentation... must be documented in same way
- Use public [github] repos massively. We love transparency, we love Pull Requests
- Use private [gitlab] On-Prmise repos when needed. We document internal processes
