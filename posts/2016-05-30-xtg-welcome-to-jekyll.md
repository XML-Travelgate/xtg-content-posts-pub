XML Travelgate uses [jekyll-docs] to render blog and documentation.

After working with rst format and rendering with [readthedocs], we decided to begin use more standard md formats rendering to html using [jekyll]

Once tools are choosen, target objectives:

* Articles, documentation,blogs, internal processes... must be documented in same way
* Use public [github] repos massively. We love transparency, we love Pull Requests
* Use private [gitlab] On-Premise repos for internal documentation
