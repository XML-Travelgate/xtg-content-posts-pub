# **How to be Agile and not “die” trying**

This is our first post about a long and never ending process, a process of continuous improvement. When talking about Agile, we prefer to start mentioning continuous improvement as this is an important key in a healthy company culture.

It is mandatory to take a first step to start walking, and our first step to start the journey to be Agile (not do Agile) was something we called “Softening”. In all change processes, without a good soil resistances could arise. In our particular culture we started this progression by having personal interviews with each one of all our community members. With the dialogues we were able to discern the real team needs. We didn’t focus only on methods and technology. We also focus on their personal insights too.

### _**"What do you like or dislike the most?” What you will change? How will you change it?"**_

Ones some of those needs are identified and to demonstrate that changes are possible, we selected the easier to get to and we compromise to achieve them, empowering the proactivity environment.
Little by little we started to get our community members to join our movement, now we were able to go further into the real team needs to finally put meaning in our work and to create impact in our clients.

### _**“If you don’t listen you’ll end up surrounded by silent people”**_

Many times people mistake methods and principles, when principles are a must in order to get methods run smoothly, however, you must turn everything what you’ve learn into routines to finally convert those sequences into practices. When lastly you accomplish practices, you mustn’t stop reviewing them, an unnegotiable continuous improvement habit is essential from now on.
If something seems to work, not necessarily is the best way of doing it, therefore we have to do our best everyday by keeping our continuous improvement in motion.

### _**“One day a very smart person put a small eraser on a pencil top, he was predicting something”**_

Testing new things always carries certain risks, they could work or fail, but when part of your framework is continuous improvement, you will be easily step back or move aside to keep moving. “What we did in the past” could be “What we do now”, why not? Circumstances and people change. The result of an improvement it is not always determinate just for the implementation itself, it also determinate by the moment.

Most of the early stages are not that easy, but we are learning to be better together with a premise, doing it little by little, that’s how big changes can be implemented, a little bit better every day.

See you in our next post!
